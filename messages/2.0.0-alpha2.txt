* Remove deprecated server functionality.
  It was an interesting ride but at the end of the day I don't think it was
  the right kind of API for cmake.

* Use the new "file API", requires cmake 3.15 or newer.
  OSX users can use `brew upgrade cmake`. Windows users can point-and-click
  to a new cmake binary, Linux users can use their package manager to update
  cmake. Ubuntu 19 users are unfortunately stuck with cmake 3.14 so you'll
  have to upgrade manually.

* Remove "NMake Makefiles" support. I don't think many people used this.
  If you really need this, consider contributing code at
  github.com/rwols/cmakebuilder.

* You can now provide an exact visual studio generator on windows. So for
  instance, "Visual Studio 16 2019" or "Visual Studio 15 2017". These are also
  the only supported ones at the moment. But that is because of the next
  bullet point.

* Fix up handling of vcvarsall.bat. Because the location of vcvarsall.bat,
  as well as the method of finding the file has changed significantly since
  VS2017, I only provide support for VS2017 and up. If you really need support
  for VS2015 and older, consider contributing code.

* We now generate a SublimeText build system in a much more compact way,
  using custom target commands.

* Terminus integration. The "Terminus" plugin is a plugin that allows you to
  reliably run a terminal from within SublimeText. CMakeBuilder uses the
  `terminus_open` command to run/debug executables from within SublimeText.
  This is exposed as just another build variant with a "Run:" prefix.
